## About

**WASM-4** is a low-level fantasy game console for building small games with WebAssembly. Game
cartridges (ROMs) are small, self-contained `.wasm` files that can be built with any programming
language that compiles to WebAssembly.

## Key Features

* **No Glue Code**: If you've ever tried to write even a simple "Hello World"
  with WebAssembly before, you'll know it usually involves writing a bunch of
  JS and HTML glue. WASM-4 removes all of that, games interface directly with
  the system through a small API.

* **Minimalist**: Fantasy consoles force developers to work with limited resources.
  This makes them simple to learn, and easier to focus on finishing your game.

* **Language Agnostic**: Use any programming language, as long as it can compile to WebAssembly. Out
  of the box we currently support: AssemblyScript, C/C++, D, Go, Nelua, Nim, Odin, Rust, WAT, and
  Zig.

* **Portable**: WASM-4 is designed to run on any device that can execute WebAssembly, even outside
  of the web! It includes a lightweight runtime written in C that runs even [low-powered microcontrollers](https://twitter.com/alvaroviebrantz/status/1518343016011943939)
  and [obsolete hardware](https://twitter.com/wasm4_org/status/1483140582943956992).

* **Netplay**: Instant online multiplayer, featuring rollback netcode. All games that support local
  multiplayer automatically support netplay. WASM-4 handles syncing controller inputs over the
  Internet.
